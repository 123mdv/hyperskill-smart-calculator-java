# hyperskill-smart-calculator-java 

This is a Java learning project from Hyperskill/JetBrains Academy, more details here: https://hyperskill.org/projects/42?goal=7

In this project, I am implementing a calculator that also remembers previous calculations, using stacks and queues, and also supports BigIntegers.
